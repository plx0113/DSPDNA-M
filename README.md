DSPDNA-M

DSPDNA-M (Digital Signal Processing + Musical DNA) is a research and product framework that decodes the full genetic structure of a finished track.
It produces a machine-readable dataset describing both the engineering decisions and the musical structure, and it renders a read-only cloud playback interface that lets people explore a plausible DAW-style session reconstructed from that data.

This document explains what DSPDNA-M outputs, how the system reasons about plugins and structure, and how the cloud playback interface provides actionable insight into the makeup of finished music.

Tagline

Every song has DNA. DSPDNA-M teaches AI to read it, visualize it, and let you explore a plausible, playable reconstruction designed for learning and inspiration.

Two-part product output

1) The Audio Genome (machine layer)

A canonical, DAW-agnostic JSON dataset that describes, with confidence scores, everything DSPDNA-M can infer.

Engineering DNA
	•	Tracks, buses, sends, and device chain classes such as eq_parametric, compressor_fet_fast, reverb_plate, and others
	•	Parameter values (Hz, dB, ms, ratios)
	•	Automation curves and fader behavior
	•	Confidence scoring and alternative hypotheses for uncertain areas

Musical DNA
	•	Key, tempo, and time signature
	•	Sections, chord progressions, melodic motifs
	•	Phrase boundaries, rhythmic patterns, and instrument roles

The dataset is precise, machine-readable, and serves as the foundation for research, training, and visualization.

Example

{
  "track": "LeadVox",
  "music_analysis": {
    "key": "C major",
    "tempo_bpm": 120,
    "section": "chorus",
    "chord_progression": ["C","G","Am","F"],
    "phrase_length_bars": 8
  },
  "dsp_chain": [
    {"class":"eq_parametric","params":{"bands":[{"type":"bell","f_hz":3200,"gain_db":2.5,"q":1.1}]}},
    {"class":"compressor_fet_fast","params":{"threshold_db":-17,"ratio":4.0}},
    {"class":"reverb_plate","params":{"rt60_s":1.3,"mix_percent":22}}
  ],
  "plugin_equivalents": {
    "reverb_plate": [{"plugin":"Valhalla Room","preset":"Large Room","confidence":0.62}]
  },
  "confidence": 0.89
}

Notes on plugin and preset statements
DSPDNA-M reports probabilistic equivalents such as “reverb resembles Valhalla Room Large Room preset with 0.62 confidence.”
That means the inferred impulse response and decay shape are similar, not that the original session used that plugin.
Time and automation are also modeled. Example: “Valhalla-like reverb predelay 15 ms between 0:45 and 1:30, send automation rising from −18 dB to −6 dB across six bars.”

2) Human layer (read-only cloud playback)

A web interface that reconstructs a plausible session layout for playback and study. It is commercial-DAW agnostic and entirely read-only. The purpose is exploration and idea generation, not editing.

Capabilities
	•	Builds a session graph using generic placeholder plugins that emulate the most likely effect or math behind the processing used on each sound
	•	Streams stems through these generic DSP blocks for playback
	•	Displays automation, routing, and musical overlays such as chords, sections, and motifs
	•	Shows per-track meters, LUFS, and gain-reduction readouts
	•	Provides confidence badges and top-k alternatives for each detected process
	•	Generates readable explanations connecting parameter data to intuitive production reasoning
	•	Suggests plausible commercial plugins that could have achieved similar results, drawn from the Plugin Zoo’s learned fingerprint matches
	•	Offers shareable, read-only project links for education, discussion, and analysis

Why this matters
DSPDNA-M does not load or replicate commercial plugins.
Instead it visualizes the underlying signal math—filter curves, dynamics envelopes, harmonic patterns, and spatial diffusion—through open DSP modules written for Web Audio and WASM.
Each placeholder module emulates the likely effect type, while the interface suggests real-world equivalents (for example “this behavior resembles Valhalla Room or Pro-R Plate”).
This approach keeps playback universal, transparent, and accessible while focusing on how the sound behaves rather than which proprietary tool created it.

How DSPDNA-M approaches the black-box problem

Reality check
A single rendered mix can come from many possible signal paths. Exact reconstruction is impossible. DSPDNA-M focuses on plausible explanations supported by evidence and calibrated confidence scores.

Inference pipeline
	1.	Uses source separation or stems when available
	2.	Fits differentiable DSP models for EQ, dynamics, and reverb behavior
	3.	Compares results with the Plugin Zoo’s preset fingerprints
	4.	Applies Cookbook priors to reflect genre and instrument conventions
	5.	Learns corrections from the Supervisor trained on real session-to-render pairs

DAW independence
DSPDNA-M avoids alignment with any single workstation.
Playback and visualization occur in the web interface using neutral DSP math and standard ontologies.
No DAW exports are generated.

Product architecture
	•	Core Decoder performs separation, feature extraction, differentiable DSP, and musical analysis
	•	Plugin Zoo stores embeddings and preset fingerprints for probabilistic matching
	•	Supervisor refines Decoder output and calibrates confidence
	•	Cookbook provides production priors and parameter ranges by genre and instrument
	•	Cloud Player runs on React, Web Audio, and WASM for playback, visualization, and overlays
	•	API manages uploads, JSON retrieval, and sharing of interactive playback links

⸻

Example of human insight in the interface
	•	“Lead vocal high-pass at 100 Hz, bell boost 3.2 kHz +2.5 dB Q≈1.1, compression 4:1 threshold −17 dB with 4 dB reduction in the chorus, reverb similar to Valhalla Room Large Room predelay 15 ms RT60 1.3 s with send automation +12 dB through the chorus.”
	•	“Kick low shelf 60 Hz +2 dB, transient shaping present, short stereo widen on hi-hats bars 9-16.”
	•	“Master loudness ≈ −9.5 LUFS, genre pop/indie, probable DAW family Ableton or Reaper though playback remains neutral.”

Metrics and release criteria

The Supervisor trains on known session pairs.
Release benchmarks include:
	•	Topology F1 ≥ 0.90
	•	Parameter MAE within target ranges per device class
	•	Calibration error < 0.08
	•	False device insertions < 5 percent

⸻

Ethics and intellectual property
	•	DSPDNA-M reports equivalence and confidence only; it never reproduces proprietary plugin code.
	•	Sample and hook detection are educational and research tools.
	•	All dataset contributions follow opt-in and anonymization standards.

Summary

DSPDNA-M creates a detailed dataset describing the engineering and musical DNA of a song.
It then uses that dataset to render a cloud playback environment with generic DSP modules that emulate the most likely effect math behind each sound and suggest plausible commercial plugins that could have produced similar results.
The system remains completely DAW-independent.
It is a tool for insight, education, and creative inspiration rather than editing or reproduction.
